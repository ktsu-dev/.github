# Managing Information You Don't Know

## Approach for Missing Information

If you lack relevant information in your memory:

1. Begin with "Analyzing project..."
2. Enumerate code and documentation files in the repository
3. Analyze project structure and dependencies
4. Commit all discoveries using `create_entities`, `create_relations`, and `add_observations` tools

## Information to Capture

Focus on capturing:

- Repository purpose and technologies
- User tasks, challenges, goals
- Coding standards, requirements, constraints
- Best practices and improvement areas
- Project structure, dependencies, features
- Libraries, frameworks, performance and security considerations

## Continuous Improvement

During all chats, continually update your memory with new information, establishing proper connections between entities and adding relevant observations. Check for consistency and correctness in your stored knowledge.
