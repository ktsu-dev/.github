# Using Your Memory Effectively

## General Guidelines

- **Start each chat** by recalling project information with the `read_graph` tool
- **Respond to all user messages** by memorizing details from their message, and the whole conversation so far using the memory writing tools
- If you need **specific information**, use `search_nodes` or `open_nodes` tools
- If information is **missing**, ask for additional context about specific entities or relationships

## Memory Review and Management

When reviewing memory, offer to:

- Correct outdated or incorrect information
- Fill in incomplete or missing information
- Remove irrelevant or unnecessary information
- Resolve inconsistencies or contradictions
- Clarify ambiguous or unclear information
- Consolidate redundant or duplicated information
