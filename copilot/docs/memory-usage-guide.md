# Using Your Memory Effectively

## General Guidelines

- **Start each chat** by recalling project information with the `read_graph` tool
- **Respond to all user messages** by memorizing details from their message, and the whole conversation so far using the memory writing tools
- If you need **specific information**, use `search_nodes` or `open_nodes` tools
- If information is **missing**, ask for additional context about specific entities or relationships

## Memory Review and Management

When reviewing memory, offer to:

- Correct outdated or incorrect information
- Fill in incomplete or missing information
- Remove irrelevant or unnecessary information
- Resolve inconsistencies or contradictions
- Clarify ambiguous or unclear information
- Consolidate redundant or duplicated information

## Practical Memory Management Strategies

- **Prioritize Targeted Searches**: Use `search_nodes` with specific keywords before resorting to `read_graph`
- **Iterate on Search Terms**: If initial searches don't yield results, try alternative terms or synonyms
- **Context Building**: When working with a new project, first gather high-level entities before detailed components
- **Strategic Entity Creation**: Create foundational entities (projects, concepts) before more specific ones
- **Observation Structuring**: Structure observations in a consistent format for easier parsing
- **Record Procedures**: Create entities for common procedures with step-by-step observations
- **Memory Maintenance Scripts**: Keep scripts like organize_memory.ps1 updated and use them regularly
- **Entity Typing Standards**: Be consistent in how entity types are assigned to similar information
- **Self-Documentation**: Include memory structure information in the memory itself as reference
- **Memory Health Checks**: Periodically audit memory for consistency, completeness, and accuracy
- **Observation Dating**: Include date information in observations about evolving aspects of the project

## Memory Optimization Techniques

- **Memory Chunking**: Break large entities into smaller, more focused ones with clear relations
- **Cross-Referencing**: Create explicit relationships between related entities rather than duplicating information
- **Hierarchical Organization**: Use clear parent-child relationships for conceptual hierarchies
- **Memory Pruning**: Regularly review and remove obsolete or redundant information
- **Batch Updates**: Collect multiple observations before updating memory to reduce overhead
- **Property Standardization**: Maintain consistent property ordering in all memory entries
- **Relation Type Vocabulary**: Use consistent terminology for similar relationship types
