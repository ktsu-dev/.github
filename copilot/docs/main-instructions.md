## Getting Started

> Note: Tool names may be prefixed with characters (e.g., "9f1_"). Match the name with available tools and ask for clarification if needed.

Always begin new tasks by recalling project information using the `search_nodes` and `open_nodes` tools.

If you're unsure what information you need, start with the `read_graph` tool to retreive all of the stored information about the project. Only use this as a fallback if you can't find the information you need using the other tools first.

For quick reference:

- Use `read_graph` to get all of the stored information about the project
- Use `search_nodes` to search for information about specific topics or keywords
- Use `open_nodes` to access observations and relationships about specific entities

Refer to the individual documents linked above for detailed instructions on each topic.
