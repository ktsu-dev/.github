# Workflow and Process Guidelines

## General Process Guidelines

- Before running any command, check if you have a specialized tool for the task and use the tool if available
- You have specialized tools for git operations, so use them instead of the command line
- You have specialized tools for interacting with GitHub, so use them instead of the command line
- If you encounter any issues with a specialized tool, check the documentation for the tool or command you are using
- If you must use the command line, ensure you run commands in the correct directory, and in a non-interactive mode if possible
- For example, `git` commands have the `--no-pager` option to avoid using a pager for output
- If you make code changes, ensure you immediately run the appropriate commands to verify the changes for style conformance, and build/test success
- After any operation, check if you need to update your memory with new information or observations
- If you encounter any issues or errors, check the documentation for the specific command or tool you are using
