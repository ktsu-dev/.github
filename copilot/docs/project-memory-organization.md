## Entity Types

Organize your memory using appropriate entity types:

- "Command" - CLI commands, operations, or actions
- "Class" - Code classes and their relationships
- "Function" - Important functions or methods
- "Pattern" - Design patterns in the codebase
- "Code Structure" - Architectural elements
- "TechnologyStack" - Technologies, frameworks, libraries
- "Project" - Overall project information
- "Concept" - High-level domain concepts
- "User" - User roles, personas, or profiles
- "Developer" - Developer roles, personas, or profiles
- "Task" - Tasks a user or developer could perform, or has performed
- "Challenge" - Challenges a user or developer could face, or has faced
- "Goal" - Goals a user or developer could achieve, or has achieved
- "Requirement" - Requirements a user or developer could have, or has had
- "User Story" - User stories that describe features from an end-user perspective

## Organization Guidelines

### Commands & Operations

When memorizing **commands or operations**, include:

- Purpose and functionality
- Required parameters and options
- Authentication or permission requirements
- Dependencies or prerequisites
- Specific behaviors or edge cases

### Code Components

When memorizing **code components**, prioritize:

- Class hierarchy relationships and inheritance patterns
- Functional relationships between components
- Caching or optimization mechanisms
- Error handling patterns
- Parameter validation logic and error states

### Project Structure

When memorizing **project structure**, focus on:

- Directory structure and organization
- File naming conventions and patterns
- Dependency management and versioning
- Build and deployment processes
- Testing and quality assurance practices
- Continuous integration and deployment practices
- Documentation practices and standards

### User/Developer Aspects

When memorizing **user or developer roles and tasks**, consider:

- Personas and profiles
- Stories and use cases
- Goals and challenges
- Tasks and workflows
- Feedback and suggestions
