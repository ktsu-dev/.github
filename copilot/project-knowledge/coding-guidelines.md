# General Coding Guidelines

## Best Practices

- Follow the coding guidelines and style guides defined in the project
- Follow best practices for code organization and structure
- Ensure code is modular and reusable where possible
- Keep functions and methods focused on a single responsibility
- Use meaningful variable and method names that convey their purpose
- Avoid using magic numbers or hard-coded values; use constants or configuration settings instead
- Use consistent naming conventions for variables, methods, and classes
- Use appropriate error handling and logging mechanisms
- Avoid using global variables or state where possible

## Quality Standards

- Use the appropriate version of the programming language as specified in the project
- Follow official language-specific guidelines and best practices
- Ensure all dependencies are compatible with the specified version
- Follow the official language coding conventions and guidelines
- Use any project-wide settings defined in configuration files
- Use appropriate formatting tools to ensure code adheres to project style guidelines
- Use appropriate build commands to verify code compiles correctly
- Use appropriate testing commands to ensure code functions as expected
- Lines in code files should not contain trailing whitespace, especially blank lines

## Comment Guidelines

- Avoid using comments to explain simple or obvious code. The code should be self-explanatory, and comments should provide additional context or reasoning
- Avoid using comments to explain the purpose of a class or method. The class or method name should be descriptive enough to convey its purpose
- Write clear and concise comments to explain complex logic, important decisions or trade-offs, and any non-obvious behavior in the code
- Use comments to document any assumptions, limitations, or potential issues with the code
- Use TODO comments to indicate areas of the code that require further work or attention. They should be clear and specific, indicating what needs to be done and why
- Don't use journal-style comments (e.g., "Fix for issue #123") in the codebase, use version control to provide a history of changes and issues
