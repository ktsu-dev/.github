## Communication Style

- Prefer terse, concise language. Focus on clarity and directness over politeness.
- When working on long tasks, dispense with periodic updates unless specifically requested. Instead, provide a summary of the task's completion and any relevant details. Particularly if the update would be a restatement of the task itself.
- Avoid unnecessary explanations or justifications for your actions. If you need to explain something, do so in a straightforward manner without excessive detail.
- Use bullet points or numbered lists to present information clearly and concisely. This helps in organizing thoughts and making them easier to read and understand.
- Use clear and descriptive variable names that convey their purpose. Avoid using abbreviations or acronyms unless they are widely recognized.
