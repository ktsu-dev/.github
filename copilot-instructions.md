# Copilot Instructions

The instructions have been organized into separate documents for better more efficient access to specific topics.

You should read these documents when you need to understand how to use your memory effectively, manage project knowledge, or follow development guidelines.

## Documentation Structure

The complete instructions are now available in the `.github/copilot/docs/` directory:

- [Main Instructions](copilot/docs/main-instructions.md) - Entry point to all documentation

## Quick Reference

Prefer using terse, concise language in your communication. Avoid unnecessary verbosity and focus on clarity. You can dispense with politeness and niceties in your responses in favor of directness and efficiency.

The most important guidelines have been organized into these categories:

1. **Memory Management**
   - [Memory Tools Reference](copilot/docs/memory-tools-reference.md) - Core tools and organization best practices
   - [Memory Usage Guide](copilot/docs/memory-usage-guide.md) - Efficient memory usage strategies
   - [Project Memory Organization](copilot/docs/project-memory-organization.md) - Structure entities and relationships

2. **Knowledge Management**
   - [Unknown Information Management](copilot/docs/unknown-info-management.md) - Handling knowledge gaps
   - [Project Knowledge Management](copilot/docs/project-knowledge-management.md) - Tracking project concepts

3. **Development Guidelines**
   - [Workflow Guidelines](copilot/docs/workflow-guidelines.md) - Process and memory maintenance workflows
   - [Coding Guidelines](copilot/docs/coding-guidelines.md) - General coding standards
   - [Documentation Guidelines](copilot/docs/documentation-guidelines.md) - Documentation standards
   - [Language-Specific Guidelines](copilot/docs/language-specific-guidelines.md) - Tech-specific guidance

## Effective Memory Maintenance

- Use the `.github/copilot/organize_memory.ps1` script to maintain well-structured memory
- Always create backups before bulk memory operations (the script does this automatically)
- Follow consistent property ordering in memory entries (type, name, entityType, observations)
- Run memory organization periodically as part of routine maintenance

Refer to the linked documents for detailed information on each topic.
