# ktsu.dev

**Modern .NET libraries that eliminate boilerplate, catch errors early, and make code self-documenting.**

ktsu.dev is a collection of focused .NET libraries designed to reduce cognitive load and minimize runtime errors through strong typing and semantic clarity. Each library solves a specific problem with clean APIs that integrate seamlessly with modern .NET practices.

## Core Philosophy

**Strong Typing & Semantic Clarity** – Replace primitive types with domain-specific types that catch errors at compile time and make code intent clear.

**Simplified APIs** – Eliminate boilerplate and abstract complex operations behind intuitive interfaces.

**Maintainable Design** – Single-responsibility libraries with comprehensive testing and consistent patterns.

**Modern .NET** – Leverage latest language features, generic math, and .NET 8+ capabilities.

## Key Libraries

### Type Safety & Semantics
- **[Semantics](https://github.com/ktsu-dev/Semantics)** – Comprehensive semantic types including strings, paths, and 80+ physics quantities
- **[PreciseNumber](https://github.com/ktsu-dev/PreciseNumber)** – Arbitrary precision arithmetic with .NET 7+ generic math
- **[SignificantNumber](https://github.com/ktsu-dev/SignificantNumber)** – Preserve numerical precision with significant figures

### Simplified APIs
- **[PersistenceProvider](https://github.com/ktsu-dev/PersistenceProvider)** – Unified persistence with multiple storage backends (Memory, FileSystem, AppData, Temporary)
- **[UniversalSerializer](https://github.com/ktsu-dev/UniversalSerializer)** – Unified serialization supporting JSON, XML, YAML, TOML, MessagePack
- **[IntervalAction](https://github.com/ktsu-dev/IntervalAction)** – Easy recurring actions without timer management
- **[Invoker](https://github.com/ktsu-dev/Invoker)** – Thread-safe delegate execution for UI apps
- **[ScopedAction](https://github.com/ktsu-dev/ScopedAction)** – RAII-style setup/teardown patterns

### UI & Tools
- **[ImGuiApp](https://github.com/ktsu-dev/ImGuiApp)** – Dear ImGui application scaffolding
- **[ImGuiWidgets](https://github.com/ktsu-dev/ImGuiWidgets)** – Higher-level UI components
- **[ImGuiPopups](https://github.com/ktsu-dev/ImGuiPopups)** – Modal dialogs and popups
- **[ImGuiStyler](https://github.com/ktsu-dev/ImGuiStyler)** – Theming and styling utilities

### Utilities
- **[CaseConverter](https://github.com/ktsu-dev/CaseConverter)** – String case conversion
- **[FuzzySearch](https://github.com/ktsu-dev/FuzzySearch)** – Approximate string matching
- **[SingleAppInstance](https://github.com/ktsu-dev/SingleAppInstance)** – Prevent multiple app instances
